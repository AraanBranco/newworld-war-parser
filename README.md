## How Print the Boards
To achieve a good result, after finishing the war, go to the results page (choose the entire board or your team's or the enemy team's) and click a few times to sort by 'Rank' (sometimes the list bugs out, clicking to sort fixes that) and take screenshots part by part following the order. When taking screenshots, avoid having messages from members leaving the party in the screenshot or you will have to adjust manually later."

## About OCR Used
The OCR used is the PaddleOCR which uses an AI model to identify images, so during the first execution it will download some models to perform the execution.
